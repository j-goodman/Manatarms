#Manatarms

Manatarms is a work in progress, with the following planned features:

### Live Demo
The only file that should be required to use Manatarms in your Javascript game is manatarms.js. The rest are there as a live demo of the library's functionality.

### Rectangular Unit Selector
Not yet implemented. Will allow the user to click-and-drag a box around their units, selecting the ones inside the box.

### Selectable Units
Not yet implemented. Running manatarms.makeSelectable when constructing a new unit will make it so it can exist in two states: selected or deselected. When deselected, the player cannot control a unit, when selected it will respond to movement controls.

### Moving Units
Selectable units can be moved to a different point on the map with a right mouse click once they're selected.
